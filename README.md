This package is meant to create a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to manual 
correct mis-tracking such as swapped labels, and mis-tracked body points 
generated by Multi-Animal tracking tools like maDLC or SLEAP.

Hopefully, you would have used AutoPoseMapper prior to use this tool. 
AutoPoseMapper should help fix most of the errors created by maDLC and SLEAP.

The GUI was built using [PySimpleGUI](https://www.pysimplegui.org/en/latest/) 
so refer to the website if you have any installation issues.
